# How to create Affiliate Marketing Content?

Many influencers claim to have the formula to create promotional content for affiliate marketing. Here I am testing the flow of technology to see how accurate and successful it is.

## Table of Contents

1. [Select a Product that offers a Commission](#select-a-product-that-offers-a-commission)
2. [Create Copy](#create-content)
3. [Text to Speech](#text-to-speech)
4. [Create images](#create-images)
5. [Conclusion](#conclusion)

## Select a Product that offers a Commission
For this test I am using Shopify with their affiliate program
## Create Content
I am using ChatGPT with the following prompt:

> You are a blog writer, not a tech person. You are writing a post in the first person about your experience of looking to start your own online business of selling natural and organic frozen green juice mix. Explain how green juice is made. Then expand how people ask you to sell them your green juice mix. Include a list of online websites similar to Shopify. Close the article concluding why Shopify was selected. This blog post should take about 1 minute to read.

## Text to Speech
I am using [11ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) to convert text to speech using AI.

## Create images
I am using [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/)to create images. For a 60 second video. Estimated 2 seconds per image. I am producing 30 images.

```python

```
