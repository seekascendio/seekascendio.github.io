# How to create Affiliate Marketing Content?

Many influencers claim to have the formula to create promotional content for affiliate marketing. Here I am testing the flow of technology to see how accurate and successful it is.

## Table of Contents

1. [Select a Product that offers a Commission](#select-a-product-that-offers-a-commission)
2. [Create Copy](#create-content)
3. [Text to Speech](#text-to-speech)

4. [Example Dataset](#example-dataset)
5. [Conclusion](#conclusion)

## Select a Product that offers a Commission
For this test I am using Shopify with their affiliate program
## Create Content
I am using ChatGPT with the following prompt:

## Text to Speech
I am using [11ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) to convert text to speech using AI.



```python
